Part 1: Theoretical Analysis (40%)
Q1. Edge AI: Reducing Latency and Enhancing Privacy

Edge AI processes data locally on devices such as smartphones, cameras, or IoT sensors rather than relying on distant cloud servers.
This reduces latency because data doesn‚Äôt need to travel to and from the cloud‚Äîdecisions are made in milliseconds.
It also enhances privacy since sensitive information is not transmitted over the internet, minimizing exposure risks.

Example:
In autonomous drones, Edge AI allows the drone to detect obstacles and make navigation decisions in real time. Instead of waiting for a cloud server to process video feeds, onboard AI chips handle object recognition instantly‚Äîcrucial for safe flight.

Benefits Summary:

‚ö° Faster decision-making

üîí Local data processing for privacy

üåê Reduced bandwidth usage

üîã Improved energy efficiency

Q2. Quantum AI vs Classical AI in Optimization

Classical AI relies on traditional processors and binary computing, which evaluate one state at a time. In contrast, Quantum AI leverages qubits that can represent multiple states simultaneously through superposition and entanglement, enabling it to explore many solutions at once.

Comparison:

Feature	Classical AI	Quantum AI
Computation	Sequential	Parallel (superposition)
Data Type	Binary	Quantum states
Optimization Speed	Slower for large problems	Exponentially faster
Energy Use	High	Potentially efficient

Industries that Benefit Most:

Pharmaceuticals: Accelerated drug discovery

Finance: Portfolio optimization and fraud detection

Logistics: Route and supply chain optimization

Energy: Smart grid management

Quantum AI holds promise for solving NP-hard problems faster than classical AI ever could.

Q3. Human-AI Collaboration in Healthcare

Human-AI collaboration in healthcare is revolutionizing diagnostics, patient care, and treatment planning. AI assists radiologists by identifying patterns in medical images, while nurses use AI-powered monitoring systems to track patients‚Äô vital signs in real-time.

Transformative Impacts:

Radiologists gain decision support tools that flag anomalies faster.

Nurses receive predictive alerts for critical conditions like cardiac arrest.

Hospitals enhance workflow efficiency, reducing errors and improving outcomes.

However, ethical considerations arise: data privacy, algorithmic bias, and over-reliance on machines. Hence, collaboration‚Äînot replacement‚Äîis the ideal model.

Case Study Critique: AI-IoT for Smart Cities

Integrating AI with IoT in smart cities enhances urban sustainability through intelligent traffic management and resource optimization.

How Integration Improves Sustainability:

Traffic Flow Optimization: AI analyzes IoT sensor data (cameras, signals) to dynamically adjust lights and reduce congestion.

Environmental Monitoring: Sensors track pollution, helping governments respond in real-time.

Challenges:

Data Security: Vast data streams are vulnerable to hacking.

Interoperability: Integrating diverse IoT devices and platforms is complex.

Part 2: Practical Implementation (50%)
Task 1: Edge AI Prototype

Goal:
Build an image classifier to identify recyclable items using TensorFlow Lite.

Implementation Steps:

Train a small CNN model in TensorFlow using sample dataset (e.g., plastic, paper, metal).

Convert model to .tflite format for deployment on Edge devices.

Test on Raspberry Pi or simulated environment (Google Colab).

Example Code (Simplified):

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

# Load dataset
train_ds = tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory("data/train", image_size=(128, 128))
val_ds = tf.keras.utils.image_dataset_from_directory("data/val", image_size=(128, 128))

# Model
model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Rescaling(1./255),
    layers.Conv2D(16, 3, activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(),
    layers.Conv2D(32, 3, activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D(),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(train_ds, validation_data=val_ds, epochs=5)

# Convert to TensorFlow Lite
converter = tf.lite.TFLiteConverter.from_keras_model(model)
tflite_model = converter.convert()
open("recycle_model.tflite", "wb").write(tflite_model)

Task 3: Ethics in Personalized Medicine (300 Words)

AI in personalized medicine uses patient genomic and medical data to tailor treatments. However, biases can arise if datasets underrepresent certain ethnic or gender groups. For example, AI models trained primarily on Western populations may yield inaccurate predictions for African or Asian patients.

Ethical Concerns:

Data Representation Bias: Limited diversity reduces accuracy.

Algorithmic Transparency: Patients rarely understand how AI recommends treatments.

Privacy Risks: Genetic data is highly sensitive.

Fairness Strategies:

Inclusive Data Collection: Incorporate global genomic datasets.

Algorithm Auditing: Regularly check for unfair outcomes.

Explainable AI (XAI): Ensure decision logic is interpretable.

Ethical Governance: Create oversight boards for medical AI systems.

By addressing these issues, AI-driven personalized medicine can achieve equitable, transparent, and patient-centered healthcare outcomes.
